# CodeCademy Intensive

### Programming_With_Python

This is the source code that I submitted as my final project for the CodeCademy Intensive Programming With Python course.

Overall, it was a fun course. There were a couple of minor issues I had, mainly with the web-based python interpreter. Nothing that could not  be overcome, though.
